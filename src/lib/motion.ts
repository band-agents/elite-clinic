/**
 * Shared motion vocabulary. Carried over from the Al-Madinah build unchanged,
 * because the three rules it encodes were each paid for by a bug.
 *
 *  1. One easing family. `soft` is the signature curve — a fast start that
 *     settles rather than bounces. Springs are reserved for things the user
 *     directly caused (a step advancing, a card lifting under a cursor),
 *     because a spring on ambient motion reads as nervous.
 *
 *  2. Motion never gates content. Every reveal variant animates from
 *     `opacity: 0` but the element is in the DOM and laid out from the start,
 *     so a failed animation leaves readable text, not a blank page.
 *
 *  3. Reduced motion is honoured at the source. `useReducedMotion()` from
 *     Framer feeds `reveal()`, so a single hook call disables travel
 *     everywhere instead of each component remembering to check.
